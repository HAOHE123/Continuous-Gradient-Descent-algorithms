Code and examples for “Analysis of gradient descent algorithms: Discrete to continuous domains and circuit equivalents”

---

## Overview

This repository contains reference implementations and examples used for the paper:

> **He Hao, Daniel Silvestre, Carlos Silvestre**, “Analysis of gradient descent algorithms: Discrete to continuous domains and circuit equivalents,” *Systems & Control Letters*, June 4, 2025.

The code covers:

- Discrete‐time gradient descent (GD) and accelerated variants (e.g., Nesterov, Heavy‐Ball, Triple‐Momentum).  
- Continuous‐time ODE counterparts for these algorithms.  
- Circuit‐equivalent Simulink models illustrating how RLC networks mimic accelerated methods.
